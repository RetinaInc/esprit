=Esprit with Shindig=

To use Shindig as an opensocial container, Esprit need to pass security token as a request parameter. For now, we have used the token generation model of Shindig, which can be modified further depending upon any SNS requirement.
Following files have been use from Shindig to form the security token:
 # Crypto.php
 # BlobCrypter.php
 # SecurityToken.php
 # BasicBlobCrypter.php
 # BasicSecurityToken.php
