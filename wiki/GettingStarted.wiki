== Introduction ==

This guide provides step by step configuration of Esprit, which is a PHP based SNS conforming to opensocial specification.


== Details ==

 # Get the esprit source code from the following location: http://esprit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ esprit-read-only
 # *Configure Database:*
   * Create a new MySql db and run the scripts kept in the file: esprit/SQL/esprit.sql.
   * Open the file esprit\src\config.php, and enter your db configurations.
 # *Configure Shindig:*
   * Get the Apache shindig source code. Make shindig up and running on your server. For more information refer to following link: http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/.
   * Once shindig is up and running, open the file esprit\src\config.php, and copy the shindig url into gadget server url. 
   * Copy the following four esprit files into the shindig’s code at shindig/trunk/php/src/socialrest/samplecontainer.
      * esprit/src/shindigFiles/espritPeopleService.php
      * esprit /src/shindigFiles/espritActivitiesService.php
      * esprit /src/shindigFiles/espritAppDataService.php
