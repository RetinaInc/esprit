This guide provides step by step configuration of esprit, which is a PHP based SNS conforming to opensocial specification.

== Prerequisites ==
 * A Subversion Client to download the code
 * PHP 5.X.X
   * Latest PHP version can be downloaded from: http://www.php.net/downloads.php
 * Apache Web server
   * Latest Apache web server can be downloaded from: http://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi   
   * We have tested Esprit with Apache but it should work with any web server.
 * MySQL 5.0
   * MySql can be downloaded from: http://www.mysql.com/downloads/index.html
 * Apache Shindig (available on 20 Aug,2008)  
   * Apache Shindig can be downloaded from: svn co http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/shindig/trunk/ <shindig> -r {2008-08-20}
== Details ==

 * *svn checkout the esprit source code from the following location:*
   * http://esprit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ <esprit-read-only>
 * *Configure Esprit:*
   * Copy downloaded esprit code in to web server's root /www/esprit or /wwwroot/esprit
   * Create a new MySql database and run the scripts kept in the file: esprit/SQL/espritsns.sql.
   * Open the file esprit/sns/config/config.php,esprit/shindigFiles/espritDBFetcher.php and enter your database configurations.
 * *Configure Shindig:*
   * Get the Apache shindig source code. Make shindig up and running on your server. For more information refer to following link: http://incubator.apache.org/shindig/.
   * Once shindig is up and running, open the file esprit/sns/config/config.php, and copy the shindig url (like http://yourdomain:port/shindig/php or if you are using virtualhost then http://shindig) into $gadget_server. 
   * Copy the following four esprit files into the shindig’s code at trunk/php/src/social-api/samplecontainer.
      * esprit/shindigFiles/espritPeopleService.php
      * esprit/shindigFiles/espritActivitiesService.php
      * esprit/shindigFiles/espritAppDataService.php
      * esprit/shindigFiles/espritDBFetcher.php
   * Open  the shindig’s shindig/php/config/container.php and change the following paths :
      * 'people_service' => 'espritPeopleService'
      * 'activity_service' =>'espritActivitiesService'
      * 'app_data_service' => 'espritAppDataService'

Now the code is ready to be moved to Apache server.Access it using the url: http://hostname:portnumber/esprit/sns/login.php


== Additional Notes ==
 * This application is tried and tested on the Apache Shindig version as on Aug 20th'08.
 * There are scripts (testData.sql in esprit/sql) for creating test users in the sns.Logging in with these users gives you an overall look and feel of the application. After running the scripts, login into esprit with following credentials:
    * Username: test1; password: test1
    * Username:test2; password: test2
 * User can also signup with esprit to create a new user.
